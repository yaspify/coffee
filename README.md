# ☕️ Basic Brewing Assumptions

## 1. Methodology

- Based on: [Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 Method](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/hario-v60-beginner-brewing-guide)
- Goal: Adjust perceived sweetness, acidity, and strength through staged pours.
- Focus: “Sweet and strong” flavor profile.
- Equipment: HARIO V60 dripper (conical, single hole).

## 2. Coffee-to-Water Parameters

You input:

- bean: grams of ground coffee (e.g., 15 g)
- watercoffeeratio: total brew ratio (e.g., 12 → 1:12 = 15 g × 12 = 180 g water)

This assumes a standard hot brew, not cold drip or immersion.

## 3. Pour Structure (4:6 Concept Adapted for Sweetness & Strength)

- The first 40% of total water (Step 2) affects sweetness and balance.
- The next 60% affects strength and body.
- Pour divisions here approximate the 4:6 balance but bias toward sweetness and richness

## 4. Water Temperature and Flow

- Assumed 90–94 °C water (slightly lower for sweetness).
- Moderate, consistent spiral pour (≈ 4–5 g/s).
- Total brew time 3 min.

## 5. Taste Preference Target

- Emphasis on sweet, rounded cup with noticeable body.
- Slightly reduced acidity compared with the neutral 4:6 ratio.
